<h1>RateYourMusic: Naming Guidelines for Mixes</h1>

This is a nomenclature proposal for [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com)'s (RYM) category which encompasses DJ mixes and live electronics. 

The problems that this project addresses are:
<ul>
	<li>Current RYM framework is unable to accommodate recordings described below, since it was created in the pre-internet era, and is oriented around physical releases.</li>
	<li>These releases are frequently deleted and just temporarily hosted.</li>
</ul>

Main goals are **information preservation** and **conciseness** when it comes to information presented to the users. This means that information supported by the website's framework, should be omitted from the title and entered in the corresponding fields, like artist's name, release date, and recording date.
