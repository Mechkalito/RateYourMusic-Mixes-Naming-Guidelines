# RateYourMusic: Naming Guidelines for Mixes

This is a nomenclature proposal for [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com)'s (RYM) category which encompasses DJ mixes and live electronics. 

This project has **information preservation** as its main goal, since these recordings are often deleted and just temporarily hosted.

### C - Radio Guest Mixes

#### NTS Radio Guest Mixes
URL for NTS Radio guest mixes looks like this: `https://www.nts.live/shows/guests ...`.

### D - Radio Shows
`RADIO_SHOW_NAME`

Radio shows that have a name, which is *not* a host's name.

Examples:
> Beats in Space  
> 88 Transition

### E - Radio Residencies
`HOST_NAME``'s`&nbsp;`RADIO_NAME`&nbsp;`Show`

Residency shows hosted by artists, labels, collectives, and event promotions. In order to differentiate them from guest mixes (C), the resident's name is included in the title and written in possessive form.

Time slot for these shows is usually 1 or 2 hours. If host is inviting guests in a longer time slot, this runtime is usually split equally between them, i.e. an hour each.

> Bicep's NTS Radio Show  
> DJ Nobu's NTS Radio Show

Examples (collective-hosted):
