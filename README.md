<h1>RateYourMusic: Naming Guidelines for Mixes</h1>

This is a nomenclature proposal for [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com)'s (RYM) category which encompasses DJ mixes and live electronics. 

Problems this proposal is addressing:
<ul>
	<li>Current RYM framework is unable to accommodate non-commercially released DJ mixes and live electronics, since it was created in the pre-internet era, and is oriented around physical releases.</li>
	<li>These releases are frequently deleted and just temporarily hosted.</li>
	<li>This temporary hosting creates archival problem, if release has been added with arbitrary title.</li>
</ul>

Since majority of these recordings are going to be deleted at some point in the not so distant future, this project has **information preservation** as its main goal.  

When it comes to information presented to the users, **conciseness** is preferred. In practice, this means that information supported by the website's framework, should be *omitted* from the title and entered in the corresponding fields, like artist's name, release date, and recording date. Additional release fields or attributes on website are desirable.

<h2>Naming Precedence</h2>

`DEDICATED_HOSTS` have precedence.  

<h2>Individual Cases</h2>

- Information inside brackets (`[]`) is optional. *See [A4](#a4), [A6](#a6)*
- Colon (`:`) is used to separate different information types, where information on the left side has precedence. *See [A4](#a4), [A6](#a6), [BCDE6](#bcde6)* 
- Double quotation marks (`""`) is used for mixes that have names, and single quotation marks (`''`) for quotation inside those names. 
- Multiplication sign (`×`), not the letter *x*, is used for collaborations between two or more entities.
- Vertical bar (`|`) signifies "or".
- *Placeholder terms* are written in uppercase with spaces substituted with underscores (`LIKE_THIS`), while *literal terms* are written capitalized using spaces (`Like This`).

<h3 id="a">A - Mixes Hosted by an Artist, Platform, or a Label</h3>
<h4 id="a1">A1</h4>

`MIX_NAME`

The most basic case where mix usually has a name.

<h4 id="a2-a3">A2 / A3 - Radio Booths & Streaming Platforms</h4>

`RADIO_NAME`  
`STREAMING_PLATFORM_NAME`

Live recordings from radio booths and streaming platforms. Notable examples are **The Lot Radio** (Brooklyn), now defunct **Red Light Radio** (Amsterdam), **Future Intel** (The Hague), and **HÖR** (Berlin).  

<h4 id="a4">A4 - Venue Recordings</h4>

`VENUE_NAME`&nbsp;[`(FLOOR_NAME)`]&nbsp;`,`&nbsp;&nbsp;`CITY_NAME`

Examples:
> "Tresor, Berlin"  
> "Tresor (Globus), Berlin  
> "Bassiani, Tbilisi"  
> "Bassiani (Horoom), Tbilisi  
> "fabric, London"  
> "Fuse, Brussels"  
> "Sub Club, Glasgow"  

<h4 id="a5">A5 - Event Series</h4>

`EVENT_SERIES_NAME`&nbsp;`@`&nbsp;`VENUE_NAME`&nbsp;`,`&nbsp;&nbsp;`CITY_NAME`  

Examples:
> Patterns of Perception @ ://about blank, Berlin  
> Klubnacht @ Berghain, Berlin  
> Vault Sessions @ BRET, Amsterdam  
> CALMA @ Zapadores, Madrid

<h4 id="a6">A6 - Festivals</h4>

`FESTIVAL NAME`&nbsp;`{YEAR}`[`:`&nbsp;&nbsp;`STAGE_NAME`][^1]  
`FESTIVAL NAME`&nbsp;`EDITION_NAME`&nbsp;`YEAR`[`:`&nbsp;&nbsp;`STAGE_NAME`][^2]

Examples:
> Dekmantel Festival 2017   
> Burning Man 2014: Robot Heart  
> CRSSD Festival Spring 2015  
> CRSSD Festival Fall 2022

<h5 id="bcde6">Festival Recordings Released as Podcast Episode, or Aired on Radio</h5>

Combination of `B` | `C` | `D` | `E` and `6`, separated with colon (`:`), with `B` | `C` | `D` | `E` having precedence. 

Festivals are big events, and for that reason this information is eligible to be included in the title.

Examples:
> TRAX.366: Paral·lel Festival 2019  
> ani/live Ten: Monument Festival 2022  
> Hessle Audio's Rinse FM Show: Club Night Club

<h3 id="b">B - Podcasts & Mix Series</h3> 

`PODCAST_NAME`  
`PODCAST_NAME`&nbsp;`:`&nbsp;&nbsp;`"`&nbsp;`MIX_NAME`&nbsp;`"`   
`PODCAST_NAME`&nbsp;`{ENUMERATION}`  
`PODCAST_NAME`&nbsp;`{ENUMERATION}`&nbsp;`:`&nbsp;&nbsp;`"`&nbsp;`MIX_NAME`&nbsp;`"`

<h4 id="b5">B5 - Event Series Released as Podcast Episode</h4>

Combination of `B` and `A5`, separated with colon (`:`), with `B` having precedence. 

I tend to avoid including `A5` information in the title, unless mix series itself is focused on the live recordings.

Examples:
> ani/live Eight: GROOVY GROOVY  
> MNMT Recordings: FUSION @ VENT, Tokyo

<h3 id="c">C - Radio Guest Mixes</h3>

`RADIO_NAME`

Radio mixes which are not part of some radio show.

<h4 id="nts-guest">NTS Radio Guest Mixes</h4>

URL for NTS Radio guest mixes looks like this: `https://www.nts.live/shows/guests ...`. *Compare with [this](#nts-named-show) and [this](#nts-residency).*

<h3 id="d">D - Radio Shows</h3>

`RADIO_SHOW_NAME`

Radio shows that have a name, which is *not* a host's name.

Examples:
> Beats in Space  
> 88 Transition  
> The Space Between Spaces

<h4 id="nts-named-show">NTS Radio Named Shows</h4>

URL for NTS Radio guest mixes looks like this: `https://www.nts.live/shows/RADIO_SHOW_NAME`. *Compare with [this](#nts-guest) and [this](#nts-residency).*

<h3 id="e">E - Radio Residencies</h3>

`HOST_NAME`&nbsp;`'s`&nbsp;`RADIO_NAME`&nbsp;`Show`

Residency shows hosted by artists, labels, collectives, clubs, and event promotions. In order to differentiate them from guest mixes (`C`), the resident's name is included in the title and written in possessive form.

Time slot for these shows is usually 1 or 2 hours. If host is inviting guests in a longer time slot, this runtime is usually split equally between them, i.e. an hour each.  

Examples (artist-hosted):
> SPFDJ's Rinse FM Show  
> Bicep's NTS Radio Show  
> DJ Nobu's NTS Radio Show

Examples (collective-hosted):
> MARICAS' Rinse FM Show

Examples (label-hosted):
> Hessle Audio's Rinse FM Show  
> Huntleys + Palmers' Rinse FM Show

<h4 id="nts-residency">NTS Radio Residency Shows</h4>

URL for NTS Radio residency shows looks like this: `https://www.nts.live/shows/HOST_NAME`. *Compare with [this](#nts-guest) and [this](#nts-named-show).*

<h4>Rinse FM Residency Shows</h4>

Rinse FM lists all their current shows at [rinse.fm/shows/](https://rinse.fm/shows/), where show-specific URL looks like this: `https://rinse.fm/shows/HOST_NAME`.

<h2>Special Cases</h2>

<h3>Collaborations</h3>

`ENTITY_ONE`&nbsp;`×`&nbsp;`ENTITY_TWO`

Entities are platforms, promotions, music collectives, labels.

Peculiar example is *Amsterdam Dance Event*, an Amsterdam-based conference that hosts multiple promotions. I would suggest to separate it in the title with vertical bar (`|`).

Examples:
> HÖR × Herrensauna  
> Vault Sessions × KHIDI | ADE 2022  
> Intercell × Perc Trax | ADE 2019

<h3>Boiler Room</h3>

`Boiler Room`&nbsp;(`CITY_NAME`&nbsp;`|`&nbsp;`COUNTRY_NAME`)[&nbsp;`:`&nbsp;&nbsp;`VENUE_NAME`]

Examples:
> Boiler Room London  
> Boiler Room Tbilisi: Bassiani  
> Boiler Room × Dekmantel Festival 2016  
> Boiler Room × AVA Festival 2022  
> Boiler Room × DGTL Amsterdam 2023
